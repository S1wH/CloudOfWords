Wordcloud is the graphical representation of text data which shows more frequent words with large text size and words with less frequency have small text size in a text corpus. It helps to understand the basic idea about given text that what is this about or for some other Machine learning or Deep Learning tasks for Natural Language Processing. There are different online tools and libraries available to feed a text input and create a wordcloud for that given text.
In python, we can use an open source library WordCloud for creating wordclouds from text input. It offers different features and methods to eliminate common words, change output graph representations and much more. For getting started in python, we first need to install this library using pip or from source.
